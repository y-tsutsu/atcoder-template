The following code is what I wrote to solve a problem in an AtCoder contest. When using generative AI to translate programming languages during an ongoing AtCoder contest, there are the following restrictions: "It is absolutely necessary to include the original code at the beginning of the submission as a comment or similar." "Only translations that do not alter the algorithm are permitted. In particular, any changes that would affect the time complexity are strictly prohibited." For any parts that cannot be directly translated, please mark them as "FAILED" and leave them unconverted. Following these strict AtCoder rules, please translate the following code from python to c++.

```py
# The value of an integer variable may exceed a 32-bit size.

```
